The Capstone Project is my final assignment with the IBM Professional Data Analyst course.
The project will culminate with a presentation of my data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report will include an executive summary, my analysis, and a conclusion. 
In this project, I am an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organisation and am presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets analysis.  

#### Executive Summary
The survey dataset is taken from Stack Overflow's open source.
In 2019, Stack Overflow had conducted an online survey of software professionals across the world. My goal is to visualise and identify the trend of programming languages & desired databases through the results.

In the Capstone Project,I have performed various tasks that include: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualisation 
- Interactive dashboard creation 


#### Methodology for the project
Data Collection
Data Collection is the first step in solving any analysis problem and can be collected in many formats and from many sources. 
In the first module of the Capstone, I collected data by scraping the internet and using web APIs.

Data Wrangling
In this module, I focused on the cleaning of the dataset with various techniques. 
With these techniques I have identified duplicate rows, finding missing values, and normalizing the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis
In this module, I began to work with the cleaned dataset from the previous module. 
I analysed the dataset to find the distribution of data, presence of outliers and the correlation between different columns.

Data Visualisation
Here,I was requested to create visualisations using the developer survey data. 
The visualisations I createed should highlighted the distribution of data, relationships between data, the composition of data, and comparison of data.

Building A Dashboard
In this module, I've created dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics. 
This platform provided the ability to create various charts while assembling a dashboard that is appealing and easy to understand. 
The dashboards will contained the data analysis, which should be intuitive and allow for the drill-down of data.

Final Assignment: Present Your Findings
I have analyzed the data in the previous modules, and now it is time to demonstrate the storytelling skills. 
I have created a compelling story that helps to clarify the analysis in an easy-to-understand presentation.
